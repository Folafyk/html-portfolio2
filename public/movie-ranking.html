<h1>The Best Movies According to Paul</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>The best movie of all time, perfect science and space representation.</p>
<h4>Poem in Interstellar:</h4>
<p>Do not go gentle into that good night,<br />
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;<br />
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br />
Though wise men at their end know dark is right,<br />
Because their words had forked no lightning they<br />
Do not go gentle into that good night.<br />
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.‚Äù<br />

<h3>Alita: Battle Angel</h3>
<p>Best Action/Sci-fi movie ever. Very realistic and fight representaion is perfect.</p>

<h3>Avengers: Endgame</h3>
<p>Emotions, fighting, action was perfect. No other superhero movie can be compared to it.</p>
